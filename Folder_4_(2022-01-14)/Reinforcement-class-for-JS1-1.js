/*
 * reviewing JS1-1 session after class
 
 * tafavot Number() va parseInt()
  ? Number("123d") => Nan  and parseInt("123d") => 123

 * variable type let => good type
                ? const => good type and they need initializing value
                   ! in const we can't use ++ or -- and change value
                ? var => not good type and don't use
                ? boolean => its good  and boolean value is true or false 

 * in variables ,we use camelCase mode to specify the name

 * Declaring a string variable =>  let str = "testStr" //! let str = "" this is the name empty string
 * Declaring a number variable =>  let num = 123
 * Declaring a boolean variable =>  let isBool = true
 
 * math operations => +,-,*,**,/,%,NaN

 * addition assignment operator => ++ , -- , += , -= , *= , ...
   ? example: let a = 10; a++ or ++a 

 ! let num = 10 { log(num++) => 10
              ! { log(++num) => 11

 * String Section:
            ? 1-in the string, the index starts from 0.
            ? 2-to access the character we can use [] after the variable name.
            ? 3-to see the how many characters includes of string we can use (.length) after the variable name.
            ? 4-We can concatenate the strings by (+) or (.concat)
            ? 5-if we add numbers to strings, we will receive string finally
      !example:
               1- let str = "strTest" => s t r T e s t
                                         0 1 2 3 4 5 6

               2- let str = "strTest" , str[3] => "T"
