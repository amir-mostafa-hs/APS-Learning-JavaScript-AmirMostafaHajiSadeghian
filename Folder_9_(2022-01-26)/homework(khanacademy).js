/*
 !# JS and the DOM :

 * script tag:
    We use (tag script) to access JavaScript code in HTML file.
    We write (script tag) in the end line (body) to execute other HTML tags for create the 
    document and elements so that we can then access the document elements with JavaScript code.
 
 * DOM (Document Object Model): 
    The browser converts web pages (HTML and CSS) into a DOM. DOM is a tool provided by the browser to manage, 
    edit or create web pages. The DOM looks like a JavaScript object. The DOM contains all the HTML tags and CSS styles we need.

    We use the global variable document to access the DOM in JavaScript.
    After writing the document, we can use the methods in it to access HTML elements and CSS styles.
    The DOM is not our main web page and is just an emulator of it. 
    The browser monitors the DOM and applies the changes to the homepage as soon as it changes.
