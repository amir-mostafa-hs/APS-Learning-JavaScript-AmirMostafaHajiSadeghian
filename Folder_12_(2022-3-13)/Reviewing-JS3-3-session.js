    ! What is node.js:
        As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, 
        Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications

            ? what is runtime:
                A runtime is the environment in which a programming language executes. 
                The runtime system facilitates storing functions, variables, and managing memory 
                 by using data structures such as queues, heaps and stacks .

            ? what is scalable network applications (or scalable web applications) : 
                When developing a web application, one of the main things you should keep in mind is its ability to easily handle 
                 the influx of users. No matter what kind of project you are aiming to launch, 
                 you have to be ready for the influx of users and expect the system to handle it. 
                Other words, the web app should be scalable and ensure smooth performance under any circumstances.
        
        Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something
         you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.

        In 2009, the Node runtime environment was created for the purpose of executing JavaScript code without a browser,
         thus enabling programmers to create full-stack (front-end and back-end) applications using only the JavaScript language.

        Now you can do much more with JavaScript than just making websites interactive.

        JavaScript now has the capability to do things that other scripting languages like Python can do.

        Both your browser JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. 
        This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. 
        Machine code is low-level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.

        Node is an entirely different runtime environment, meaning that browser-environment data values and functions,
         like window.alert(), can’t be used. Instead, the Node runtime environment gives back-end applications access 
         to a variety of features unavailable in a browser, such as access to the server’s file system, database, and network.
